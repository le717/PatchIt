PatchIt! 
========
This is the readme to **PatchIt!**, a [Python 3](http://www.python.org) application written by [Triangle717](http://Triangle717.WordPress.com).

What is PatchIt!
---------------
Although _LEGO® Racers_ modding is still in it's early stages, many mods are already being developed, and there 
needs to be a standard way to install them. Heavily influenced and based on **Patchman!**, a mod installer for 
the 1999 Data Design Interactive PC game _LEGO® Rock Raiders_, **PatchIt!** is the standard and simple way to
package and install mods for the 1999 High Voltage Software PC game _LEGO® Racers_

How It Works
------------
The three main goals for **PatchIt!** are as follows:

* Ask for the _LEGO® Racers_ installation, ensure one exists at that location, and store it in an open file format in the **PatchIt!** installation 
to be used as the Patch installation directory, and to create a completely portable (thumb-drive) application.
* Create a **PatchIt!** Patch by entering the mod name, version, author, and description, and point it to the modded files. Automatically compress the files into an open archive format (.PiA), 
and write the details to an open file format (.PiP), using the name and version for the filenames.
* Install a **PatchIt!** Patch by selecting the .PiP file, confirming the installation, and automatically decompressing the Patch archive directly into the _LEGO® Racers_ installation.
