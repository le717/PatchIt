* The third line of the settings files (namely, `Racers.cfg`) defines the current state of the first-run check. In a fresh installation of **PatchIt!**,
the number is `0` (zero), meaning the settings have not been set up. After th game installation is selected, the number is changed to `1`,
meaning no action is needed.
